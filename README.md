# Problem description (working on)
In this project the objective is finding the most effective factors among proposed on our data set (such as 'Eligiblity', 'Participant age', 'Participant gender' and etc) on 'quality score'. In fact, a questionnaire was designed by one the iranian medical researcher institue (Cohort) to collect data from their studied group. These questionnaires were filled via an interview and at the end of the interview, they considered a score to describe the quality of the collected data. They believe factors such as participants' education level, ehnicity, and things like these and also the interviewers' work experience, age and etc have effect on the qulity score of collected data but they do not know which factor or factors are most effective. Hence, we are going to invesigate this issue step by step, from early and simple data analysis methods such as visulization to advanced manners like learning a Neural Network to find correlation.
